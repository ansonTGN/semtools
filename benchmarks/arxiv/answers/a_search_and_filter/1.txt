  found in your dataset:

  Key Papers on Attention Mechanisms:

  1. "Transformers are Graph Neural Networks" (2506.22084v1.txt)
    - Discusses the attention mechanism as the central component
  of Transformers
    - Explains how attention allows representations to capture
  relative importance between words
    - Covers how Transformers build representations in parallel
  via attention mechanisms
  2. "Lorentz Local Canonicalization" (2505.20280v1.txt)
    - Compares Minkowski attention to Euclidean attention
    - Shows benefits of different attention mechanisms in
  geometric contexts
  3. "Survival Analysis as Imprecise Classification with 
  Trainable Kernels" (2506.10140v1.txt)
    - Proposes models that can be trained using different
  attention mechanisms
    - Includes neural network-based attention and Gaussian kernel
   attention weights
  4. "A Dataset for Distilling Knowledge Priors from Literature 
  for Therapeutic Design" (2508.10899v1.txt)
    - References "MolE: a foundation model for molecular graphs
  using disentangled attention"
    - Focuses on attention mechanisms for molecular graph
  analysis
  5. "Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and"
  (2507.21589v1.txt)
    - References "Sara-rt: Scaling up robotics transformers with
  self-adaptive robust attention"
    - Discusses attention mechanisms in robotics applications

  The most comprehensive discussion of attention mechanisms
  appears in the Transformers paper (2506.22084v1.txt), which
  explains the fundamental concepts and mathematical foundations
  of attention in neural networks.
