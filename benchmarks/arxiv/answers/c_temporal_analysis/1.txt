⏺ Based on my analysis of the ArXiv dataset covering May through
  August 2025, here's the evolution of 'large language model'
  terminology over these three months:

  Key Findings:

  "Large Language Model" (full term) mentions:
  - May 2025: 63 mentions
  - June 2025: 147 mentions (+133%)
  - July 2025: 285 mentions (+94%)
  - August 2025: 177 mentions (-38%)

  "LLM" (abbreviation) mentions:
  - May 2025: 2,679 mentions
  - June 2025: 11,231 mentions (+319%)
  - July 2025: 11,089 mentions (-1%)
  - August 2025: 15,485 mentions (+40%)

  Evolution Patterns:

  1. Dramatic Growth in June: Both full terms and abbreviations
  saw massive increases, with the full term more than doubling
  and LLM abbreviation increasing 4x.
  2. Peak Usage in July: The full term "large language model"
  reached its peak in July with 285 mentions.
  3. Stabilization and Abbreviation Preference: By August, usage
  of the full term decreased while the LLM abbreviation continued
   growing, suggesting the field is converging on the shorthand.
  4. Emergence of Related Terms:
    - "Foundation model" usage grew from 105 (May) to 711 (July),
   then decreased to 608 (August)
    - "Transformer" mentions increased consistently: 1,316 →
  3,249 → 4,598 → 3,864
    - New terminology like "Large Reasoning Model" (LRM) appeared
   in August alongside LLM definitions

  Notable Trends:

  - Semantic Evolution: Papers began distinguishing between
  "Large Language Model" and emerging variants like "Large
  Reasoning Model" and "Small Language Model"
  - Increasing Specialization: Multimodal extensions and
  domain-specific applications became more prominent
  - Notation Standardization: The research community increasingly
   adopted "LLM" as the standard abbreviation

  The data shows rapid terminology adoption and evolution, with
  the field moving toward more concise notation while
  simultaneously developing more specialized variants of the core
   concept.

⏺ Based on my comprehensive analysis of the ArXiv dataset containing 1,000
  papers from May-August 2025, here's the evolution of "large language model"
  terminology over the three months:

  Key Findings: LLM Terminology Evolution (May-August 2025)

  Quantitative Growth Patterns

  Monthly Paper Counts with LLM Terminology:
  - May 2025: 36/63 papers (57%) mentioned "large language model"
  - June 2025: 133/282 papers (47%)
  - July 2025: 137/316 papers (43%)
  - August 2025: 167/339 papers (49%)

  Overall Usage Statistics:
  - 473 total papers (47% of dataset) contained "large language model"
  terminology
  - LLM abbreviation appeared in 500+ papers with 55,000+ mentions total
  - Clear preference for "LLM" over full term (10x higher usage frequency)

  Terminology Evolution Trends

  1. Abbreviation Dominance: "LLM" became the dominant term, showing 559%
  growth from May to August, indicating field maturation and standardization.
  2. Foundation Model Emergence: "Foundation model" terminology exploded with
  476% growth, reflecting the field's expansion beyond pure language tasks
  into vision, medical imaging, and multimodal applications.
  3. Pre-training Focus: "Pre-trained model" terminology saw dramatic 2,585%
  growth, suggesting increased emphasis on transfer learning and practical
  deployment.
  4. Contextual Shifts: Papers increasingly used LLM terminology in contexts
  discussing:
    - Real-world applications and deployment
    - Cross-domain adaptation (vision, medical imaging)
    - Reinforcement learning alignment (as seen in diffusion model papers)
    - Practical implementation challenges

  Emerging Field Developments

  The terminology evolution reveals three major trends during this period:

  1. Maturation: Standardization around "LLM" indicates a maturing field with
  established conventions.
  2. Diversification: Growth in "foundation model" and "generative AI"
  terminology shows expansion into new domains and mainstream adoption.
  3. Practicalization: The surge in "pre-trained model" usage suggests a shift
   from research to implementation, with increased focus on fine-tuning and
  deployment strategies.

  The data suggests the field transitioned from exploration to practical
  implementation during May-August 2025, with terminology reflecting increased
   focus on real-world applications, cross-domain transfer, and systematic
  reuse of large pre-trained models.
