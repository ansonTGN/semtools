⏺ Analysis Complete

  I found when specific technical terms first appeared in the ArXiv paper
  titles from your 1,000-paper dataset:

  Key Findings:

  2505 (May 2025) - Most terms first appeared:
  - LLM (42 occurrences) - "Towards Fully FP8 GEMM LLM Training at Scale"
  - Neural (45 occurrences) - "Stochastic Preconditioning for Neural Field
  Optimization"
  - Transformer (13 occurrences) - "CardioPatternFormer: Pattern-Guided
  Attention..."
  - Diffusion (30 occurrences) - "DiSA: Diffusion Step Annealing..."
  - Attention (15 occurrences) - Same transformer paper
  - Multimodal (38 occurrences) - "Project Riley: Multimodal Multi-Agent
  LLM..."

  2506 (June 2025) - Traditional ML terms appeared:
  - Reinforcement Learning (26 occurrences)
  - Machine Learning (12 occurrences)
  - CNN, RNN, LSTM - Classic architectures
  - GPT (4 occurrences) - "Identifying a Circuit for Verb Conjugation in
  GPT‑2"

  Later appearances:
  - Few-shot - 2507 (1 occurrence)
  - GAN - 2508 (1 occurrence)

  The dataset shows modern AI terms dominated early (May 2025), while
  traditional ML terms appeared later, suggesting this captures a period when
  transformer-based models were central to AI research.

  - Paper: 2507.21728
  - Title: "A Generalized Few-Shot Transfer Learning Architecture for Modeling
   EDFA Gain Spectrum"

  Key Observations

  1. Vision-Language Models appeared earliest (position #3), indicating this
  was a dominant research area
  2. Diffusion models appeared very early (position #11), showing their
  continued importance
  3. LLMs and Fine-tuning appeared together early (position #15), reflecting
  the focus on LLM optimization
  4. Most foundational AI/ML terms appeared within the first 50 papers of May
  2025
  5. More specialized terms like Few-shot learning appeared much later in the
  timeline

  The data shows May 2025 was particularly rich in diverse AI/ML research
  topics, with most major technical terms making their first appearances in
  paper titles during this month.
