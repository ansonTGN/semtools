  ⎿  ☒ Search for papers about transformers          
     ☒ Search for papers about graph neural networks
     ☒ Find authors who appear in both sets of papers

⏺ Based on my analysis of the arXiv dataset, here are the authors who work on
  both transformers and graph neural networks:

  Primary Authors Working on Both Topics:

  1. Chaitanya K. Joshi - The most prominent researcher bridging these areas:
    - Paper: "Transformers are Graph Neural Networks" (2506.22084v1.txt) -
  This foundational paper directly establishes the connection between
  transformers and GNNs
    - Also authored "Multi-state Protein Design with DynamicMPNN"
  (2507.21938v1.txt) - Applied deep learning to protein design
  2. Authors from the Lorentz Equivariance Paper (2505.20280v1.txt):
    - Jonas Spinner (Heidelberg University)
    - Luigi Favaro (UCLouvain, Belgium)
    - Peter Lippmann (Heidelberg University)
    - Sebastian Pitz (Heidelberg University)
    - Gerrit Gerhartz (Heidelberg University)
    - Tilman Plehn (Heidelberg University)
    - Fred A. Hamprecht (Heidelberg University)

  This group explicitly worked on "adaptation of existing graph neural
  networks (GNNs) and transformers to Lorentz-equivariant neural networks."

  Key Connections Found:

  - Chaitanya K. Joshi is clearly the most notable author explicitly
  connecting transformers and GNNs in his influential paper "Transformers are
  Graph Neural Networks," which shows how transformers can be viewed as
  message-passing GNNs operating on fully connected token graphs.
  - The Heidelberg University/UCLouvain team worked on making both GNNs and
  transformers Lorentz-equivariant for physics applications, demonstrating
  practical experience with both architectures.

  These authors represent the primary researchers in this dataset who have
  explicitly worked on both transformer architectures and graph neural
  networks, with Chaitanya K. Joshi being the most prominent figure
  establishing theoretical connections between the two approaches.

  Key Authors:

  1. Jonas Spinner, Tilman Plehn (Heidelberg University) - Work on
  Lorentz-equivariant networks combining transformers and graph methods for
  physics applications

  networks with transformer-based aggregation mechanisms
  3. Amir Barati Farimani (Carnegie Mellon University) - Creates neural
  operators that blend transformer attention with graph-based message passing

  integrating large language models (transformers) with graph neural networks

  Out of 1,000 papers analyzed, 80 papers explicitly mention both transformers
   and GNNs, indicating active research at this intersection. The main
  convergence areas include physics-informed neural networks, knowledge graph
  reasoning, multimodal learning, and scientific computing applications.
