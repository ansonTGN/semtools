a. Simple Search & Filter
    1. "Find papers discussing 'attention mechanisms'" (semantic - various terms like self-attention, cross-attention, etc.)
    2. "Find papers with exact title containing 'BERT'" (exact match - tests tool choice)
    3. "Show papers about machine learning optimization" (semantic - various related terms)
    4. "List all papers with 'v2' in their filename" (exact match - file pattern)
    5. "Find papers on computer vision applications" (semantic - CV, image processing, etc.)

b. Cross-Reference & Relationships
    1. "Find papers with similar abstracts to paper 2506.09738v1" (pure semantic similarity)
    2. "Which authors work on both 'transformers' and 'graph neural networks'?" (semantic topic overlap)
    3. "Find exact co-author relationships for papers containing 'meta-learning'" (hybrid: semantic + exact)
    4. "The author in './by_author/Yang_Yang' has the most papers. What did they discuss and was their ressearch similar to others published at the time?" (semantic author overlap)
    5. "Show collaboration patterns between computer vision and NLP researchers" (semantic field identification)

c. Temporal Analysis
    1. "Track the evolution of 'large language model' terminology over the three months" (semantic evolution)
    2. "Find when specific technical terms first appeared in paper titles" (exact temporal tracking)
    3. "Identify emerging research themes in August 2025" (semantic trend detection)
    4. "Compare semantic similarity of abstracts between June and August papers" (semantic temporal analysis)
    5. "Find authors who shifted research focus between months" (semantic topic change detection)
